I made a lot of bad design choices early on that I ended up not having time to fix. App is split into three pages, home, everything to do with making a character, and user. The character page has different states that it slowly moves though, displaying different components as they are required. It should definitely have just been multiple pages but I was just struggling to get it mostly finished by the end.
