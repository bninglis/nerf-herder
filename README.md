My final project for the BrainStation web development bootcamp is a React application called the Scum and Villainy Character Creator. The application is designed to assist players of the tabletop role-playing game Scum and Villainy in creating their characters.

The character creation process in Scum and Villainy can be complex and time-consuming, so the Character Creator simplifies the process by providing a step-by-step guide. The application uses interactive form fields to allow users to easily input their character information and save their progress as they go.

To support data persistence, the application uses a REST API built with Express and a MySQL database accessed through the Knex query builder. This allows users to save their character information and pick up where they left off at a later time.

Overall, the Scum and Villainy Character Creator is a helpful tool for players of the game who want to streamline the character creation process and save their progress. It is user-friendly and intuitive, making it easy for players to create their characters quickly and efficiently.
